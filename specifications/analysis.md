I'll analyze your proposal from first principles and help develop specifications for an initial system.

## First Principles Analysis

### Core Problem
LLMs struggle with contextual reliability during extended conversations due to:
1. Limited context management
2. Premature assumptions
3. Over-reliance on recent responses
4. Inability to efficiently organize and retrieve relevant past information

### Fundamental Requirements
1. **Information Persistence**: Long-term storage of conversation data
2. **Relevance Determination**: Identifying what matters for current context
3. **Efficient Retrieval**: Quick access to relevant historical information
4. **Context Prioritization**: Managing limited attention capacity
5. **Information Compression**: Reducing redundancy while preserving meaning

### Customer Knowledge Bias Consideration
The system needs to account for domain-specific knowledge and user preferences, which should be:
- Explicitly defined by customers
- Captured implicitly through interaction patterns
- Updated continuously as conversations evolve

## Initial System Specifications

### 1. Context Store Architecture
- **Data Model**:
  - Hierarchical structure: Session → Conversation → Topic → Exchange
  - Metadata schema including timestamps, topic tags, importance scores
  - Vector embeddings for semantic representation
  - Raw text storage with compression for verbatim recall

- **Storage Implementation**:
  - Distributed database with tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)
  - Automatic archival policies based on usage patterns
  - Indexing for both keyword and semantic retrieval

### 2. Context Manager Functions
- **Prioritization Algorithm**:
  - Recency weighting with exponential decay
  - Importance scoring based on user engagement signals
  - Topic coherence measurement for contextual grouping
  
- **Compression Methods**:
  - Extractive summarization for long exchanges
  - Abstractive compression for conceptual retention
  - Entity and relationship preservation mechanisms
  
- **Working Memory Allocation**:
  - Dynamic token budget management
  - Content type-based allocation (facts vs. narrative context)
  - Interrupt mechanisms for high-priority information

### 3. Retrieval System Design
- **Query Processing**:
  - Hybrid retrieval combining keyword, semantic, and temporal search
  - Query expansion using entity recognition
  - Contextual disambiguation of ambiguous terms
  
- **Relevance Scoring**:
  - Multi-factor ranking incorporating:
    - Semantic similarity to current context
    - Historical importance in conversation
    - User interaction signals
    - Temporal recency/importance
  
- **Integration with External Knowledge**:
  - API interfaces for domain-specific knowledge bases
  - Separation of conversation memory from factual recall

### 4. Context Window Optimizer
- **Summarization Engine**:
  - Progressive summarization at multiple granularities
  - Topic-based clustering for coherent compression
  - Preservation of critical details and commitments
  
- **Template System**:
  - Context-aware prompt construction templates
  - Dynamic template selection based on conversation state
  - Parameter optimization for template instantiation
  
- **Token Optimization**:
  - Important entity preservation
  - Redundancy elimination
  - Context-specific abbreviation mechanisms

### 5. Implementation & Evaluation Framework
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Context retention accuracy over time
  - Response consistency across conversation turns
  - Retrieval precision and recall for historical information
  - Computational efficiency (latency, memory usage)
  
- **Testing Protocol**:
  - Synthetic conversation generation with controlled context shifts
  - A/B testing framework with baseline comparison
  - Human evaluation rubrics for contextual coherence

### 6. Customer Knowledge Interface
- **Explicit Knowledge Definition**:
  - Domain taxonomy configuration
  - Entity importance weighting
  - Topic prioritization controls
  
- **Implicit Learning**:
  - Interaction pattern analysis
  - Feedback incorporation mechanisms
  - Progressive adaptation to conversation styles

This specification provides a comprehensive starting point for addressing the context management challenges in LLMs while allowing for customer-specific knowledge bias to be incorporated throughout the system.
